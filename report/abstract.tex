We examine sentiment Analysis on Twitter data. Through the following paper we develop,
analyze and compare the most powerfull proposed solutions on the topic. Our Analysis focuses
on text preprocessing, feature extraction and machine learning application techniques, the combilation of  which have surprisingly achieved a very high accurancy on our final results. Finally, the trade-off between execution time and accurancy is being discussed.
