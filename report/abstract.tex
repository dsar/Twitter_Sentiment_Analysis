In this report, we present a comprehensive study of sentiment analysis on Twitter data, where the task is to predict the smiley to be positive or negative, given the tweet message.
With a fully automated framework, we developed and experimented with the most powerful proposed solutions in the related literature, including text preprocessing, text representation, also known as feature extraction, and supervised classification techniques.
Different combinations of these algorithms led to a better understanding of each component and exhausting test procedures resulted in a very high classification score on our final results.
