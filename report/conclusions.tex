\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

In this report we described possible preprocessing steps, text representation options and test results for a variety of classification algorithms, which was followed by a concrete comparison.

As you see in Table~\ref{overall}
two of our approaches achieved top-$3$ scores in Kaggle's competition,
with the one employing a convolutional neural network to reach the
$87.54\%$ of correct predictions.
