	Nothing radically new seems to have emerged
	with respect to text preprocessing; as in previous
	editions of this task, participants use a mix of by
	now obvious techniques, such as negation scope de-
	tection, elongation normalization, detection of am-
	plifiers and diminishers, plus the usual extraction
	of word n-grams, character n-grams, and POS n-
	grams. The use of sentiment lexicons (alone or
	in combination with each other; general-purpose or
	Twitter-specific) is obviously still frequent.
